                means many majors participate in a year-long project determined by the team. This year, there was a need 
                for a drivetrain and controls system, so the senior design team took on these projects to attempt to meet 
                HPS team goals that have never been possible in the past.</h4><br/>

                the senior design team worked to design, prototype, test, redesign, build, and test these systems to give a 
                baseline design for the following yearâ€™s team.</h4><br/>
